# Belly Button Biodiversity using Plotly

## Purpose

The purpose of this page is to show the use of Plotly charts built in JavaScript and rendered using HTML & bootstrap.  

## Website Use

The website allows a user to select a participant ID and view the participants demographic info and 3 charts of the data for that participant.  Plotly is used to render the three charts. Below is a brief description of each one:

**Bar Chart**

The barchart shows the top 10 samples collected for the participant. 

**Gauge Chart**

The guage chart shows the number of times per week the participant indicated they washed their belly button.  

**Scatter Chart**

The scatter chart shows all the samples collected for the Partipant ID with the markers changing size based on the amount collected.

## Website customizations
To further enhance the site, the following changes were made to the original:

1. An image was added to the page title.
2. A background and font color was added to the selection box to make it stand out more.
3. The font for the charts were changed to match the other fonts on the page.
